# ✨ Magic Light ✨

This project for the course IC212 at ENSTA aims to implement a simple light synchronization system. Multiple motes are connected to a wireless network, and they can synchronize the color of their LEDs according to multiple events such as the presence of a person in the room, the music being played, etc.
