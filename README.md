# ✨ Magic Light ✨

This project for the course IC212 at ENSTA aims to implement a simple light synchronization system. Multiple motes are connected to a wireless network, and they can synchronize the color of their LEDs according to multiple events such as the presence of a person in the room, the music being played, etc.

The source code for the AIOT Play mote is located in the `src_aiotplay` directory. The code is inspired by the [AIOT Play projects](https://github.com/aiotsystems/aiot_play_fw.git) of INRIA Paris.
